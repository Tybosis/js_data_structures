# JavaScript Data Structures

by Tyler Pottle

## Description

A collection of various data structures inplemented in JavaScript

### Doubly Linked List

The linkedlist.js file contains my version of a [doubly linked list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) in JavaScript, with insert, remove, and search methods.

My sources for this project were the Wikipedia article linked
above, as well as this youtube video on [creating linked lists is JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UESEbKb_uWw).

### Stack

The stack.js file contains my implementation of a [stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29) in JavaScript,
with push and pop methods.
